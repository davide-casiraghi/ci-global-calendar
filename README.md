# Global Contact Improvisation Calendar

The **CI Global Calendar** is part of the **Round Robin Project (RRP)**, an international adventure initiated in 2008, to serve the dance form **Contact Improvisation (CI)** and all the people worldwide who are engaged in that work—dance practitioners, performers, researchers, teachers, and any other interested people. 

The goal of the **CI Global Calendar** is to make information about Contact Improvisation events easily accessible in several languages—representing, at a glance, CI activities around the globe. It offers listings of CI classes, jams, workshops, festivals, and events happening throughout the global CI community, posted individually by event organizers and teachers.

The calendar is still in beta testing phase and not yet available online, we plan to fully operate starting from January 2019 on.
